		<h2>The Church</h2>
		<h3>What is the Church</h3>
		<p>The Methodist Church believes and teaches that the Church is the company of all those who believe in the Lordship of Christ, who are baptized in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and who live in the power of the Holy Spirit. The Church is One, despite its divisions, Holy, despite its imperfections, Catholic (that is, Universal), embracing all human beings everywhere, despite its local character, and Apostolic, being a sent community and having been founded on the teaching and testimony of the Apostles. The Church is Christ's Church. It is the Body of Christ, and He is its Head. From Him comes the church's mission, power and authority.</p>
		<p> The Church exists to fulfil the whole ministry of Christ. He has commanded the Church to "make disciples of all nations". The mission of the Church is fulfilled as the Church worships, witnesses, fellowships, cares and serves. The local church, through its membership and the larger community, exercises the ministry of Christ where it is, and, at the same time, shares in the wider ministry of the Church in the world.</p>
		<p> As the Body of Christ, the Church lives in the world, addressing it with the Gospel and continuing Christ's ministry of reconciliation. As it does so, it participates in Christ's suffering, and also in his power and victory. Thus, the Church constitutes a new humanity, and is the nucleus of a redeemed and transformed universe. The Church therefore seeks the evangelization and the renewal of the world. Its main task in the world is to bring people face to face with Christ so that they may acknowledge His Lordship.</p>
		<h3>The Methodist Church</h3>
		<p>Here is a working definition of the Methodist Church: </p>
		<p>“The Methodist Church is that communion of Christian believers which has grown out of the Societies born of the Evangelical revival of the eighteenth mid nineteenth centuries. It "claims and cherishes its place in the Holy Catholic Church, which is the Body of Christ, It rejoices in the inheritance of the Apostolic Faith, and loyally accepts the fundamental principles of the historic Creeds of the Protestant Reformation. It ever remembers that in the providence of God Methodism was raised up to spread Scriptural holiness through the land by the proclamation of the evangelical faith, and declares its unfaltering resolve to be true to its Divinely appointed mission."” (See Third Edition of the Constitution and Discipline of the MCCA, page 39.)</p>
		<p>An examination of this statement, along with other statements, reveals the following four characteristics of the Methodist Church: </p>
		<p>(i)	It is a Christian Church - Its only true Head is Christ, and its membership is made up of persons who have committed themselves to Christ as His disciples. All its doctrines are based "upon the Divine revelation recorded in Holy Scriptures", and whatever the Methodist Church proclaims and teaches as necessary for salvation is found in the Scriptures.</p>
		<p>(ii)	It is a Catholic Church - "Catholic" here refers to the universality of the Church. We are a part of the universal Church of Jesus Christ, participating in His mission to the world. As Jesus came to save the world, so Methodists are sent into the world with His Gospel of Redemption. This was most aptly put by John Wesley when he said, "The World is my Parish." The word "Catholic" also refers to the inclusive nature of the Methodist Church. No difference is made on the basis of social status, race, class, gender or origin. Anyone can become a member of the Methodist Church. There is only one qualification for membership: the desire to be saved from sin through faith in Jesus Christ and to become His disciple. In our Church's Constitution we read: “All persons who sincerely desire to be saved from their sins 6 through faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who evidence the same in life and conduct and who seek to serve Christ in the life of the Church and the world by accepting the duties and privileges of confirmed membership having been baptised welcomed are confirmed in membership at their request....” (See Third Edition of the Constitution and Discipline of the MCCA, page 41.) </p>
		<p>(ii)	IThe word "Catholic" also means having a concern for the whole person and the whole of society. Methodists therefore avoid dividing people into body, mind and soul, and we avoid speaking of salvation only in "spiritualistic" terms. Salvation is for the total person and the total society. This means that the Methodist Church is concerned with the forgiveness of sins, but also with the food people eat; concerned about heaven and hell, but also with housing and health; concerned about eschatology, but also with education; concerned about justification by faith, but also with justice for all; concerned about the life of prayer, but also with the elimination of poverty. Whatever affects the lives of persons as individuals or as a community concerns Methodists, and calls us to witness to the Lordship of Christ.</p>

Whatever affects the lives of persons as individuals or as a community concerns Methodists, and calls us to witness to the Lordship of Christ.</p>
		<p>(iii)	It is a Connexional Church. The term "Connexional" refers to the fact that the congregations, circuits and districts are interdependent. The stronger ones are therefore able to help the weaker ones so that the ministry of Christ can be more effectively performed. The essence of Connexionalism is the creative sharing and effective use of the resources of the Church in the interest of mission and evangelism. Related to this is the phenomenon of itinerancy. The essence of the Church is mission and evangelism, and itinerancy is only a strategy for effective ministry on the part of the Connexion.</p>
		<p>The word "Connexional" highlights the form of Church Government adopted by Methodism. Each local church or congregation exercises its ministry and mission according to the needs of its context, but it is part of a Circuit, and carries out its work in co-operation with the other congregations in the Circuit. The Congregation is represented in the Congregational Council, which represents, locally, the Circuit Council, which is the decision-making body for the Circuit.</p>
		<p>A number of Circuits are formed into a District and the District Conference is the decision-making body of the District. It meets annually. The supreme court of the MCCA is the Connexional Conference. The Connexional Conference is served by four officers - (The President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer of Connexional Funds), in addition to the Connexional Council and four commissions. </p>
		<p>Unlike the congregational form of government which places the decision-making in the local congregation, or the Episcopal form of government which places the decision making in the hands of (the bishop or his/her 7 representative, the Connexional form of church government places the power of decision-making in the courts of the Church. The levels of decision making and the courts of the MCCA are: </p>
		<p>• The Congregational Council and Congregational Pastoral Council, 
		<br>• The Circuit Council, Circuit Pastoral Council and Preachers Meeting 
		<br>• The District Conference, 
		<br>• The Connexional Conference and Connexional Council.</p>
		<p>(iv) It is an Evangelical Church As Methodists, we always remember that Methodism was raised up by God through the human instruments of John Wesley and Charles Wesley "to spread Scriptural Holiness throughout the land by the proclamation of the Evangelical Faith". The term "evangelical" does not refer to a particular style of preaching or type of Worship, but rather to the content and purpose of the preaching.</p>
		<p> An evangelical church proclaims the Good News of the Gospel. The central concern of the truly evangelical church is Salvation from sin through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and the life of Christian holiness and discipleship. This has been our concern from the beginning, still is, and will always be. For this reason, the Methodist Church emphasises that the "desire to be saved from sins through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ" is the basic requirement for membership. And having become a member, it is a basic expectation that members "engage in evangelism and other forms of Christian service, and to contribute to the funds of the church in proportion to their means" (Constitution and Discipline p. 41).</p>
		<p> "Evangelical" also highlights the place given to the work of the Holy Spirit. Methodists recognize the central role the Holy Spirit plays in every aspect of the Church's life; its ministry, mission, worship, fellowship and service, and in the life of each Christian. The Church is powerless without the Holy Spirit, who is God's gift to Christ's Church. The Christian community is not called to negotiate or to programme the Holy Spirit, but to receive the gift and become obedient to His lending.</p>

		<h3>The Start of Methodism</h3>
		<a href="http://www.ministrymatters.com/all/entry/6401/the-wesleys-holiness-and-life-in-the-spirit" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.ministrymatters.com/images/custom/18935/rf.jpg" class="pull-left img-responsive" style="width:40%;height:40%"></a>

		<p>It is generally accepted that the founders of the Methodist movement were John and Charles Wesley.</p>
		<p>Both John and Charles went to Oxford University. John became Fellow of Lincoln College in 1726, and was ordained a priest in the Church of England (Anglican Church) in 1728.  Charles, still a student began to meet with a group of friends for reading and religious study.</p>
		<p>John became involved as the group's senior member, and its activities expanded to include charitable work among the poor and the imprisoned.  Their concern for disciplined spirituality earned them the nickname "The Holy Club" or "Methodists" for their methodical approach.</p>
		<p>John Wesley's quest for holiness and peace with God took him to the new colony of Georgia, in 1735, to work among the settlers and the Native Americans. After a disappointing ministry in Georgia he returned to England three (3) years later, but during his time there he made contact with a group of Moravian Christians whose vibrant faith and assurance made a deep impression on him...</p>

		<h3>Methodism in the Caribbean</h3>
		<p>It is generally accepted that Methodism came to the Caribbean in 1760 when a planter from Antigua, named Nathaniel Gilbert.  Gilbert was a lawyer, the owner of two sugar estates returned to Antigua and the Speaker of the Antiguan House of Assembly.  He was, prior to his religious experience, very suspicious of and averse to anything that savoured of "enthusiasm".</p>
		<p>Sometime in 1755, Nathaniel Gilbert was ill and sent his daughter Mary, who was five years old to fetch a certain book from another room. Mary brought to him was a treatise of John Wesley, "An Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion."  This had been sent to him by his brother Francis and was in fact not the book he had wanted at the time.  However, with time on his hands, the ill Nathaniel Gilbert read it and was never the same man again.</p>
		<p>As a result of this Gilbert two years latter journeyed to England, with three of his slaves.  A drawing room meeting was arranged in Wandsworth on January 15, 1759, with John Wesley as the preacher.  Nathaniel Gilbert and two of his slaves were converted.  He returned to the West Indies in 1759.  With his return Gilbert began to preach to his slaves in Antigua...</p>

		<p>The MCCA has eight Districts and has its headquarters in Antigua.  The eight Districts are Bahamas/Turks and Caicos Islands, Belize/Honduras, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Leeward Islands, Panama/Costa Rica and South Caribbean.</p>
		<p>Up to 1996 the Conference of the MCCA met annually in May.  In 1997 the MCCA made some changes to its structure.  The Conference was renamed the Connexional Conference and now meets every three years.  In between the meetings of the Connexional Conference its executive body, the Connexional Council acts on its behalf.</p>
		<p>Also in 1997 Districts were given greater responsibility to make decisions affecting their work. Consequently the District Synod was renamed the District Conference, and the title Chairman of the District is now called District President...</p>

		<h3>Doctrines</h3>
		<img src="https://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/05/16/01/00/interlocking-hands-769472_960_720.jpg" class="pull-left img-responsive" style="width:30%;height:30%"><p>The Doctrines which the Methodist Church in the Caribbean and the Americas holds and teaches are "The Doctrines of the Evangelical Faith which Methodism has held from the beginning". These doctrines are based on the Divine revelation recorded in the Holy Scriptures, which the Methodist Church acknowledges as the supreme rule of faith and practice. They are expounded "In Wesley's Notes on the New Testament and in the first four volumes of his sermons". The notes and sermons are intended to "set up standards of preaching and belief" in order to secure loyalty to the fundamental truths of the Gospel of Redemption and to ensure the continuing witness of the Church to the realities of the Christian experience of salvation.</p>
		<p>The evangelical doctrines which are preached include the following:</p>
		<ul class="doctrines">
			<li> The Holy Trinity</li>
			<li> The Divine creation of the world</li>
			<li> The universality of sin and its consequences</li>
			<li> The Incarnation and Atonement of Christ</li>
			<li> The universality and completeness of Salvation in Christ</li>
			<li> The witness and work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the Believer and the Church Conversion and the New Birth</li>
			<li> Christian Justification and the Assurance of Salvation</li>
			<li> The doctrine of Sanctification or Perfect Love</li>
			<li> The Church as the Body of Christ</li>
			<li> The Sacraments as Means of Grace</li>
			<li> The Resurrection, Judgement and the After Life</li>
			<li> The Kingdom of God</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Beliefs</h3>
		<h3>The Sacraments</h3>
		<p> The Methodist Church recognizes two sacraments: </p>
		<p>( 1 ) Baptism and (2) The Lord's Supper, also called Holy Communion. We accept these "as of Divine appointment and perpetual obligation", and we urge that it is the duty and privilege of all members of the Methodist Church to avail themselves of them.</p>
		<p>(1)	The Sacrament of Baptism, done by affusion or emersion is administered both to those who are not able to answer for themselves (infants) and to those who can (other children and adults). It is the initiatory sacrament which enters us into a covenant with God. It is not the new birth, but a sign of regeneration and a mark of Christian discipleship.</p>
		<p>On the meaning and benefits of Baptism Wesley wrote: </p>
		<p>“Baptism is the initiatory sacrament, which enters us into covenant with God. It was instituted by Christ, who alone has power to institute a proper sacrament, a sign, seal, pledge and means of grace, perpetually obligatory on all Christians. The matter of this sacrament is water; which as it has a natural power of cleansing, is more fit for this symbolic use. Baptism is performed by washing, dipping, or sprinkling the person in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. By Baptism we are admitted into the Church, and consequently made members of Christ, its Head. As the Jews were admitted into the Church by circumcision, so are the Christians by Baptism. By baptism, we who were "by nature children of wrath", are made the children of God... being grafted into the body of Christ's Church, we are made (he children of God by adoption and grace". (Treatise on Baptism). Baptism is not the new birth: They are not one and the same thing...and they do not constantly go together. (Sermon on "The New Birth")</p>
		<p>(2)	The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper: For Methodists, the Lord's Supper is a representation of our redemption, a memorial of the sufferings and death of Christ, and a token of love and union which Christians have with Christ and with one another." It is both a converting and confirming ordinance, administered in both kinds (that is, bread and wine) to all who sincerely desire to be saved from their sins through faith in Jesus Christ and who earnestly seek to become His faithful disciples.</p>
